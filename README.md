# PremierLeagueStats_201617_to_202122
This repository contains Premier League player stats for the 2016/17 to 2021/22 seasons. I scraped the data from a popular football stats website, FOTMOB, and the data is now available in a .JSON format. I used Beautiful Soup for the scraping, before manipulating the data into the .JSON format. I then created a Pandas dataframe of the entire set of stats, indexed by year and club. I used Pandas and Matplotlib to analyse and visualise some of the stats further.

Please feel free to use my .JSON file -  I would appreciate any mentions / credit if you do so.
